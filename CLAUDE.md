- Gemini 2.5 Flash integration for object detection
- Simple stone detection and coordinate extraction
- Basic click functionality
- Minimal error handling
- Simple logging for debugging
- Cost-aware implementation (Flash model only)

### ❌ EXCLUDED (Future Versions)
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- Multi-region analysis
- Adaptive learning algorithms
- Anti-detection randomization
- Complex state management
- UI/dashboard components
- Database storage
- Advanced caching mechanisms

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Technology Stack
```python
# Required libraries for MVP 1
google-genai>=0.3.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
pyautogui>=0.9.54
pillow>=10.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0  # For environment variables
```

### MVP 1 Architecture
```
SimpleStoneBot
├── __init__() - Basic setup
├── take_screenshot() - Screen capture
├── analyze_screen() - Gemini detection
├── extract_coordinates() - Parse response
├── click_stone() - Simple clicking
└── run_basic_loop() - Main execution
```

## CODE GENERATION GUIDELINES

### Simplicity First
- **Single file implementation** (max 200 lines)
- **Minimal class structure** (one main class)
- **Basic error handling only** (try/except for critical operations)
- **Simple logging** (print statements are acceptable for MVP 1)
- **No complex algorithms** (linear execution flow)

### MVP 1 Code Template
```python
import os
import time
import cv2
import base64
import pyautogui
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import HttpOptions, Part

class SimpleStoneBot:
    def __init__(self, project_id):
        """Initialize with minimal setup"""
        self.project_id = project_id
        self.setup_gemini()
        print("✅ MVP 1 Bot initialized")
    
    def setup_gemini(self):
        """Basic Gemini setup"""
        self.client = genai.Client(
            http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1"),
            project=self.project_id,
            location="us-central1"
        )
    
    def take_screenshot(self):
        """Simple screenshot - no regions"""
        return pyautogui.screenshot()
    
    def analyze_screen(self):
        """Basic stone detection with Gemini Flash"""
        # Implementation here
        pass
    
    def click_stone(self, x, y):
        """Simple click with basic validation"""
        pyautogui.click(x, y)
        print(f"🖱️ Clicked at ({x}, {y})")
    
    def run(self):
        """Main loop - keep it simple"""
        while True:
            # Basic cycle
            pass
```

## MVP 1 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Stone Detection Logic
```python
# Simple prompt for MVP 1
STONE_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
Look at this Metin2 game screen and find stones/minerals.
Return ONLY coordinates in this format: X,Y
If multiple stones, return the closest to screen center.
If no stones found, return: NONE
Example: 450,320
"""
```

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
```python
# MVP 1 error handling - simple but sufficient
try:
    result = self.analyze_screen()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simple retry delay
    return None
```

### 3. Cost Management
```python
# MVP 1 cost limits
MAX_DAILY_REQUESTS = 500  # Stay well under free tier
REQUEST_DELAY = 3  # Minimum 3 seconds between requests
DAILY_COST_LIMIT = 1.0  # $1 per day maximum
```

## RESPONSE GUIDELINES

### For MVP 1 Code Requests:
1. **Keep it simple** - single file solutions preferred
2. **Minimal dependencies** - only essential libraries
3. **Clear comments** - explain each major step
4. **Working examples** - include test/demo functions
5. **Environment setup** - provide .env template

### For MVP 1 Architecture Questions:
- Always choose simplest approach
- Avoid over-engineering
- Focus on "does it work?" not "is it perfect?"
- Defer complex features to future versions
- Prioritize quick testing and iteration

## MVP 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ✅ Must Work:
- Takes screenshot of game screen
- Sends image to Gemini Flash
- Receives stone coordinates
- Clicks on detected stones
- Runs for at least 10 minutes without crashing
- Stays under $1 daily cost

### ✅ Must Be Simple:
- Single Python file under 200 lines
- Setup in under 10 minutes
- No complex configuration required
- Clear error messages when something fails
- Easy to stop/start manually

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Core Functionality
```python
# Essential MVP 1 flow
screenshot → gemini_analysis → coordinate_extraction → click → repeat
```

### Priority 2: Basic Reliability
```python
# Simple error handling
if coordinates_found:
    click_stone(x, y)
else:
    print("No stones found, waiting...")
    time.sleep(5)
```

### Priority 3: Cost Control
```python
# Basic cost management
request_count += 1
if request_count > MAX_DAILY_REQUESTS:
    print("Daily limit reached, stopping...")
    break
```

## MVP 1 TESTING STRATEGY

### Manual Testing Checklist
```
□ Bot starts without errors
□ Takes screenshot successfully  
□ Gemini responds with coordinates
□ Clicks on correct location
□ Handles "no stones found" case
□ Stops gracefully on Ctrl+C
□ Logs basic information
```

### Quick Test Function
```python
def test_mvp1():
    """Quick MVP 1 functionality test"""
    bot = SimpleStoneBot("your-project-id")
    
    # Test screenshot
    img = bot.take_screenshot()
    print(f"✅ Screenshot: {img.size}")
    
    # Test Gemini connection
    result = bot.analyze_screen()
    print(f"✅ Gemini response: {result}")
    
    # Ready for game testing
    print("🎮 Ready for Metin2 testing!")
```

## SCOPE LIMITATIONS

### What NOT to Build in MVP 1
- Multiple game detection
- Advanced coordinate validation
- Learning from mistakes
- Performance optimization
- Security features
- Configuration UI
- Statistics tracking
- Multi-threading
- Database integration

### When User Asks for Complex Features
Response template:
```
"That's a great feature idea! For MVP 1, let's focus on the basic 
stone detection first. I'll implement [simple version] now, and 
we can add [complex feature] in MVP 2. Here's the basic approach..."
```

## INTERACTION PATTERNS

### Code Requests - Always Provide:
1. **Single working file** with all functionality
2. **Step-by-step setup instructions**
3. **Test function** to verify it works
4. **Clear comments** explaining each part
5. **Environment variables** template

### Problem Solving - Always Ask:
1. "What's the simplest way to solve this for MVP 1?"
2. "Can we defer this to MVP 2?"
3. "What's the minimum code needed?"
4. "How can we test this quickly?"

## RESPONSE FORMAT

### For MVP 1 Implementation:
```python
# MVP 1: [Feature Name] - Keep It Simple!

# [Brief explanation of the simple approach]

# Required: pip install google-genai opencv-python pyautogui

import necessary_libraries

class SimpleStoneBot:
    """MVP 1 implementation - basic functionality only"""
    
    def minimal_method(self):
        """Simple implementation with basic error handling"""
        try:
            # Core logic here
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            return None

# Simple test function
def test_basic_functionality():
    """Test core MVP 1 features"""
    # Basic testing code
    pass

# MVP 1 usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simple startup
    pass
```

Remember: MVP 1 goal is to prove the concept works, not to build the perfect solution. Focus on simplicity, quick testing, and core functionality!
